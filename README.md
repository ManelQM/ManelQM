### Hi there 👋

# Hello! 👋 I'm Manel Montalbán Quesada

## About Me

I am a passionate individual with a diverse background in Philosophy, Industrial Automation and Robotics, and Full Stack Development. As a licensed graduate in Philosophy and a certified technician in Industrial Automation and Robotics, I bring a unique blend of critical thinking and technical expertise to my work. Also Spanish is my native language! 

## Skills & Languages

- **Full Stack Development**: I recently completed a bootcamp at GeeksHubs Academy to become a Full Stack Developer, where I honed my skills in front-end and back-end development.

- **Languages**: I have a level B1 proficiency in English (currently studying to obtain the official certification). Additionally, I am proficient in German (A1 level) and French (A1 level), enabling me to connect with people from different cultures.

## Professional Experience

I have had the privilege of working in both the cement and naval industries, taking on responsibilities in process standardization, quality control, and product testing. My expertise in certifying product safety within the naval industry has provided me with a keen eye for detail and an unwavering commitment to engineering excellence.

## Beyond Technology

I am also a passionate bassist and have a profound interest in music and graphic arts. I find music to be a powerful form of expression, which complements my technical focus and allows me to channel my creativity.

Apart from my technical endeavors, I am an avid reader, constantly immersing myself in new philosophical trends and exploring the depths of artificial intelligence. I believe in staying informed about the latest advancements in both fields to broaden my perspectives and stay on top of the cutting-edge developments.

## GitHub & Collaboration

I'm excited to be a part of the GitHub community, where I can showcase my projects, share code, and collaborate with like-minded individuals. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn, improve, and contribute to exciting new ventures.

## Let's Connect!

Thank you for visiting my profile! If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to connecting with individuals who share interests in technology, music, art, and anything fascinating in life.
